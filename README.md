# ToDo List App!

I was excited to begin work on a new project using Vue, so I created this ToDo List Application to learn the basics of Vue. It's a simple app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and on top of their daily to-dos.

## About
This ToDo List app allows users to manage their tasks in a clean, intuitive interface. The app was built using Vue.js, allowing me to get hands-on experience with Vue's reactivity system and components. 

### Key Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks and set descriptions.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can update the details of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed once they're completed or no longer needed.
- **Task Status**: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.

The goal of this project was to learn about Vue and build something practical that could be used daily.
